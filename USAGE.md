# Usage
## Folder setup

- Fork the repository to your personal Github account.
- Clone the repo to your computer. You can use any git client such as [git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download/windows64), then move your existing project folder to the cloned repo inside your computer.
  - If you are going to instantly create new project instead of moving your already-created project, you can use Android Studio. Go to `File - New Project - Check out project from Version Control - Git`.
  - If you have an existing project but still want to use Android Studio to manage your Version Control, go ahead but do not create new project.
- Edit the README.md as needed.

## Project submission
- Create all future lab submissions inside the cloned repo.
- During project creation, make sure the folder name follow this format: `Meeting## - <Project Name>`. The numbering should use one leading zero.
- When your submission is finished, go to `VCS - Commit`.
- Enter the proper commit message and make sure all checked files are the ones that will be updated to the system.
- In case of minor edits, check the option `Amend commit` to avoid trash commits.
- Click `Commit and Push` to immediately update your Github.
- Last commit for each submission is Wednesday after assignment, on 23:59 UTC+7.
